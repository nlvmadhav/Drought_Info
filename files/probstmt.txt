"Though shortage of water triggers drought, it has been classified into various types viz., meteorological, hydrological, agricultural for better understanding, monitoring and management. Drought is characterized by its creeping onset and withdrawal and there can't be any definitive beginning or end of its occurrence. What is considered as a drought like condition in a particular climatic setting may not be considered to have the same impact in another climatic setting. Effective management and mitigation of drought impacts are not easy due to such ambiguities. Drought Management (2016) of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare, Govt of India has desired that declaration of drought by the State Governments should be supported by the matrix-based analysis based on rainfall indices, hydrological indices, vegetative indices, progression of crop sowing and other parameters. (Ref:http://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/Manual%20Drought%202016.pdf). Further, National Crisis Management Plan for Drought (2019) suggested a framework of crisis analysis with vulnerability magnitude, on a scale of 0-10, as area specific measure with appropriate strategic response matrix. (Ref: http://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/CRISISMANAGEMENT- PLAN 2019.pdf) With the available information and forecast by agencies on rainfall, soil moisture, surface and groundwater levels, colour coded areas may be generated using google maps for display of vulnerability magnitude for the whole country at district/sub-district level. It may also be designed as easily accessible stand-alone App which can generate location specific notifications to the common user. It will aid in better monitoring and management of portents of drought by inter-ministerial Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG) and State Drought Monitoring Centres (DMCs) apart from disseminating information to the general public."
